	  The picture on the left is an in-progress photo of this website. The final product will be a crowd-sourced local campground review and social networking site, where users can see postings about different campgrounds, what they're rated, and can also leave comments. The front-end design includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript.The website also includes backend features such as comments, login and password,and user postings. ExpressJS is used for the NodeJS framework. MongoDB is used to create and connect different databases to store and exchange information. Lastly, PassportJS is used to integrate authorization and authentication features, such as login and passwords.

		While proving to be my most difficult project to date, I've learned a great deal about backend programming. This project helped me become familair with key technologies that are necessary for building a fully functioning website. Once the project is completed I'll be proud to say that I'm on my way to being a full-stack developer.

		  Spot the Color is a game in which the user must click on the correct color that is described in the header as an RGB value. The user picks from a random color pallette that can contain either 6 colors or 3, depending the on the game difficulty that the user can select. The current difficulty is displayed in highlighted text. There is also the option to select a new color from a different color pallette by clicking on the "new colors" button. Every time the user clicks on the incorrect color, that color will disappear and the text "Try Again" will appear on the header. Once the correct color is chosen, the main header and the entire color pallette will change to the given color. This game is made from HTML, CSS, and regular Javascript. 	
		  This project helped develop my skills with Javascipt, DOM manipulation, loops, and event handling.

	  After going on many dates and finding myself running out of date ideas, I decided to create QPID: A full-stack website that allows users to find different date ideas by category. Some categories include cheap, adventurous, and creative dates. As of now, the front-end design is mostly complete but I have hopes to add backend features in the future that include user logins, user postings about their own date experiences, comments, and reviews of certain date ideas. Reviews and comments will help decide "trending dates" that will show the hghest rated and trending date ideas. Currently the website is made with HTML, CSS, and some Javascript for basic fade and scroll animations.

	  This image gallery was my first project using the Bootstrap 3 grid layout. It's a straight-forward website in which I learned how to input navbars, glyphicons, jumbotrons and place pictures of different sizes within the bootstrap grid. This project also gave me a good understanding of anchor tags and referencing pictures from the internet.
