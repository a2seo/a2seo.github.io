	Who I Am
	</h1>

		Part time engineer. Full time creator.

</br>

	<p class = "default">
		My name is Andrew Seo. I'm a first-year mechatronics engineering student at the University Of Waterloo and was born and raised in Mississauga, Canada. From a young age, I had a passion for creating. I found myself very interested in anything related to design including visual arts, film, and fashion. I also soon realized that I was very interested in computers, science and mathematics. After wondering what jobs were available in the future that combined these two seemingly opposing fields, at the age of 12 years old I concluded that I wanted to be an engineer and have since worked my way towards that goal.

	</p>

</div>
<div style="margin:15px">

	<p class = "default transition-right">
	  Now that I've taken the first steps towards my dream, I've made even more goals, including being an adept full-stack developer. I love that as a developer I can express myself and others' style in a way that is practical and much needed in today's society. As a hardworking and creative individual, I spend most of my time learning about how I can make better, more sophisticated code to develop apps and interactive software for my community to enjoy. 
	 </p>
	 <p class = "default transition-right">
	  When I'm not programming or studying, I spend my free time playing sports, hanging out with friends, and watching shows on Netflix-of course.
	</p>
	<p class = "default transition-right">
	  In the future,I want to use my abilities to make myself and others happy. With such an insurgence in technology, apps, and websites over the past decade there are endless ways to ameliorate people's lives. Whether it be from making apps that can detect a user's heartrate to help them reach their fitness goals, or a dating app that can help couples pick their next dates, there is always a way to help make lives easier and more entertaining as a developer. Great things come from small ideas and I plan to leave my mark on the world in any which way I can.
